 bavaria.1.t:0 "The Bavaria Soviet Addresses the People"
 bavaria.1.d:0 "The crowd gathered noisily outside of the city hall of Munich. The State Soviet had announced that they would come out to present a speech within the hour, and it was only a minute until the speech was scheduled to start. The crowd cheered as the spokesperson for the State Soviet emerged onto the stage. The speech was rather standard for the Soviet, as the spokesperson firmly promised stability and prosperity for the people. Near the end, the spokesperson shifted up the topic with some praise towards factories that exceeded their quotas and some discussion about local arts. The crowd would cheer loudly again as the State Soviet representative exited the stage. He was bound to be heading back to another task; after all, the Bavarian Soviet's work never ends."
 bavaria.1.a:0 "Glory to the Soviet"
 bavaria.2.t:0 "A Meeting with Stalin"
 bavaria.2.d:0 "The air was cold as the members of the Bavarian Soviet walked through Moscow; for they had been called here for a private meeting with Stalin himself. The mere thought of the man chilled some of the members to the bone; he was not one to be trifled with. When they finally arrived, a stern Stalin tersely welcomed them into a private office, and the representatives nervously took their seats. The meeting started out with standard conversation, mostly on the rising economic growth of both nations and the people's prosperity, but Stalin eventually revealed the real reason why he had called them here; he sternly informed them of a great threat to their stability. "The threat of Trotskyism is the greatest danger to Socialism I have seen, comrades. I insist that you crush this venomous snake before it poisons your country with partisan strife." With this new information in hand, the Bavarian Soviet returned home, more than ready to defend communism from foolish deviancy."
 bavaria.2.a:0 "For the People"
 bavaria.3.t:0 "The Trotskyist Threat"
 bavaria.3.d:0 "With knowledge of this new threat at hand, the Bavarian Soviet now started to draw up plans on how to root it out. Stalin made clear note of possible sympathies within the army to look for, but also to look within the state systems themselves. After a long day of discussion and planning, the agreement was made; the state would use its resources to formulate a list of possible Trotskyists, who would then be put on trial for treason against the state."
 bavaria.3.a:0 "Now to Begin the List"
 bavaria.4.t:0 "Investigations into the Army"
 bavaria.4.d:0 "talk about how stalin gave them descriptions of radical thoughts they should purge but how during the investigation it was pretty obv that none of the bavarians knew who trotsky was but people were added to the list anyway due to paranoia"
 bavaria.4.a:0 ""
 bavaria.5.t:0 "Call the People to Action"
 bavaria.5.d:0 "the soviet should make a speech to bavaria in munich that denounces trotsky and tries to make a threat towards those who support him but once again it falls on deaf ears given most german workers have been too busy trying to survive since the collapse to care for international socialist infighting"
 bavaria.5.a:0 ""
 bavaria.6.t:0 "Investigations into the Soviet"
 bavaria.6.d:0 "within the soviet there will likely be a higher chance of people knowing of trotsky and even chances of sympathies however akin to how stalins own purge had very little basis in reality within bavaria there is also no plans for a trotsky coup or rebellion so those added to the list are likely just poltical enemies who are most likely innocent"
 bavaria.6.a:0 ""
 bavaria.7.t:0 "Formation of the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit"
 bavaria.7.d:0 "basically paranoia is high enough that the soviet will now start to spy on their own peope in fear of the trotsky menace, probs good to mention how this violation of freedoms is probs a bit hypocritcal, but anyone who says that is now on the list and also that the stasi are probs given far too much legal power"
 bavaria.7.a:0 ""
 bavaria.8.t:0 "Announcement of a Church Investigation"
 bavaria.8.d:0 "the catholic church is a core part of bavarian culture so an investiagtion into them would likely cause massive issues for national unity, however a bolshevik government would def hate how much power the church has and are basically using the oppertunity to try stamp out the opium of the masses, also I think it'll be good to have a quote from heller denouncing this action"
 bavaria.8.a:0 ""
 bavaria.9.t:0 "The Begginning of the Arrests"
 bavaria.9.d:0 "with the list completed the soviet will start to arrest people, this will likely cause some panic so they'll probs make a short statement to ease tension, tho this will likely fail, they'd probs start with small figures they could arrest without much issue, but once they try arrest church members there should be public backlash like crowds protecting Bishops"
 bavaria.9.a:0 ""
 bavaria.10.t:0 "The Trials Begin"
 bavaria.10.d:0 "the trials should be very clearly a sham to all involved tho the soviet themselves should have drunk the coolaid enough to think there is an actual trotsky threat, all those put on trial will be found guilty and either shot or deported to the ussr and then into gulags, also mention who with this done and the crushing of hellers march that the soviet now holds uncontested power over bavaria"
