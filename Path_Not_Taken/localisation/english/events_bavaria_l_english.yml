 bavaria.1.t:0 "The Bavaria Soviet Addresses the People"
 bavaria.1.d:0 "The crowd gathered noisily outside of the city hall of Munich. The State Soviet had announced that they would come out to present a speech within the hour, and it was only a minute until the speech was scheduled to start. The crowd cheered as the spokesperson for the State Soviet emerged onto the stage. The speech was rather standard for the Soviet, as the spokesperson firmly promised stability and prosperity for the people. Near the end, the spokesperson shifted up the topic with some praise towards factories that exceeded their quotas and some discussion about local arts. The crowd would cheer loudly again as the State Soviet representative exited the stage. He was bound to be heading back to another task; after all, the Bavarian Soviet's work never ends."
 bavaria.1.a:0 "Glory to the Soviet"
 bavaria.2.t:0 "A Meeting with Stalin"
 bavaria.2.d:0 "The air was cold as the members of the Bavarian Soviet walked through Moscow; for they had been called here for a private meeting with Stalin himself. The mere thought of the man chilled some of the members to the bone; he was not one to be trifled with. When they finally arrived, a stern Stalin tersely welcomed them into a private office, and the representatives nervously took their seats. The meeting started out with standard conversation, mostly on the rising economic growth of both nations and the people's prosperity, but Stalin eventually revealed the real reason why he had called them here; he sternly informed them of a great threat to their stability. "The threat of Trotskyism is the greatest danger to Socialism I have seen, comrades. I insist that you crush this venomous snake before it poisons your country with partisan strife." With this new information in hand, the Bavarian Soviet returned home, more than ready to defend communism from foolish deviancy."
 bavaria.2.a:0 "For the People"
 bavaria.3.t:0 "The Trotskyist Threat"
 bavaria.3.d:0 "With knowledge of this new threat at hand, the Bavarian Soviet now started to draw up plans on how to root it out. Stalin made clear note of possible sympathies within the army to look for, but also to look within the state systems themselves. After a long day of discussion and planning, the agreement was made; the state would use its resources to formulate a list of possible Trotskyists, who would then be put on trial for treason against the state."
 bavaria.3.a:0 "Now to Begin the List"
 bavaria.4.t:0 "Investigations into the Army"
 bavaria.4.d:0 "Stalin had been very clear about where to look for Trotskyist traitors - within the army. "If your men are armed and hostile, you cannot run the state!" he had scowled. "Make sure none of them are dirty divisionists, and arrest the ones who are!" In the end, after a long search, no real evidence was found to confirm the identities of any army-based divisionists. Nonetheless, some soldiers were arrested anyway for the sake of relieving the Soviet's paranoia."
 bavaria.4.a:0 "It had to be done..."
 bavaria.5.t:0 "Call the People to Action"
 bavaria.5.d:0 "Another day, another speech. The usual huge crowd had gathered to hear the Soviet's representative talk, but today they were taken aback as the representative began to go on a vile rant about something called "Trotskyism". "It must be purged from our nation forevermore, to safeguard the very hopes and dreams of this country!" the representative proclaimed. The people were in deep confusion. They had never heard of a man named Trotsky before, and if he was around, why wouldn't the Soviet arrest him? Ultimately, the speech fell on deaf ears - the citizens had far more pressing matters than silly socialist infighting..."
 bavaria.5.a:0 "Damn it!"
 bavaria.6.t:0 "Investigations into the Soviet"
 bavaria.6.d:0 ""Gregor, how would he have anything to do with Trotsky?" Martha insisted, rather annoyed at the apparent incompetence of her fellow Soviet member. They had been assigned the important task of deciding which members were to be arrested for sympathies to the blight of Trotskyism. "I need an answer!" Martha seethed, pissed that her bud couldn't do his job right. "Martha, you don't remember this man? He was after my job just a few months ago," Gregor smoothly replied, not even looking up from the paperwork he was filing to likely doom the man's career. Martha took a moment to process before coming to a decision."
 bavaria.6.a:0 ""I have a few more suggestions...""
 bavaria.7.t:0 "Formation of the Ministerium für Staatssicherheit"
 bavaria.7.d:0 ""By the proclamation of the Bavarian Soviet, you are now the head of the Stasi." Gregor took the badge and stapled it onto his chest with honor. It was more than just a badge to him - it symbolized his unstoppable climb in the Soviet ranks. It was unfortunate that he had needed to leave Martha behind, but she was just holding him back, anyway. Her complaints about the privacy of the citizens meant nothing to Gregor - this was about containment of a serious threat to the nation. If she couldn't see past that, perhaps she was a Trotskyist herself. Gregor shook away the thought that the paranoia might be starting to get to the higher-ups."
 bavaria.7.a:0 "They know what they're doing. They trust me."
 bavaria.8.t:0 "Announcement of a Church Investigation"
 bavaria.8.d:0 "The angry mob standing outside of the church was not huge, but it was enough to send a message. Hours earlier, Stasi officials had entered the building, initiating a raid as part of a larger investigation into the Bavarian Catholic Church for "potential Trotskyist ties". If the people had not cared before, they certainly cared now. Outrage was widespread, and a certain man known by the name of Heller went as far as to make a public condemnation of the actions of the Stasi. A confrontation between the two forces now seemed unavoidable..."
 bavaria.8.a:0 "We should pray now, despite the Stasi."
 bavaria.9.t:0 "The Beginning of the Arrests"
 bavaria.9.d:0 "Gregor was mightily pleased with himself. Having just ordered the arrests of everyone on the List in incremental portions, he was certain that all was going to go perfectly, and he would probably earn a promotion for a job well done. But only an hour later, Gregor was in a panic. The public had not reacted kindly to the news of mass arrests, especially of bishops. Crowds had begun to form around bishops to protect them from the Stasi, and some of those crowds had turned into riotous mobs. "The Soviet surely has everything under control," Gregor reassured himself out loud, still alone in his office."
 bavaria.9.a:0 ""For my sake, they had better.""
 bavaria.10.t:0 "The Trials Begin"
 bavaria.10.d:0 "The trials scheduled for the Trotskyist offenders were swift and brutal. Very little effort was given to conceal the sham of the trials, for Heller's march had already been crushed - there was no opposition strong enough to protest. The various offenders - soldiers, citizens, bishops, politicians - found themselves either executed shortly after by firing squads or deported to Russian gulags. Martha found herself among those deported. She had stayed silent during her trial, but she had locked eyes with Gregor for the whole 20 minutes, as if to say..."
 bavaria.10.a:0 ""You did this.""
