 bavaria.1.t:0 "The Bavaria Soviet Addresses the People"
 bavaria.1.d:0 "The crowd gathered noisily outside of the city hall of Munich. The State Soviet had announced that they would come out to present a speech within the hour, and it was only a minute until the speech was scheduled to start. The crowd cheered as the spokesperson for the State Soviet emerged onto the stage. The speech was rather standard for the Soviet, as the spokesperson firmly promised stability and prosperity for the people. Near the end, the spokesperson shifted up the topic with some praise towards factories that exceeded their quotas and some discussion about local arts. The crowd would cheer loudly again as the State Soviet representative exited the stage. He was bound to be heading back to another task; after all, the Bavarian Soviet's work never ends."
 bavaria.1.a:0 "Glory to the Soviet"
 bavaria.2.t:0 "A Meeting with Stalin"
 bavaria.2.d:0 "The air was cold as the members of the Bavarian Soviet walked through Moscow; for they had been called here for a private meeting with Stalin himself. The mere thought of the man chilled some of the members to the bone; he was not one to be trifled with. When they finally arrived, a stern Stalin tersely welcomed them into a private office, and the representatives nervously took their seats. The meeting started out with standard conversation, mostly on the rising economic growth of both nations and the people's prosperity, but Stalin eventually revealed the real reason why he had called them here; he sternly informed them of a great threat to their stability. "The threat of Trotskyism is the greatest danger to Socialism I have seen, comrades. I insist that you crush this venomous snake before it poisons your country with partisan strife." With this new information in hand, the Bavarian Soviet returned home, more than ready to defend communism from foolish deviancy."

 bavaria.3.t:0 "The Trotskyist Threat"
 bavaria.3.d:0 "With knowledge of this new threat at hand, the Bavarian Soviet now started to draw up plans on how to root it out. Stalin made clear note of possible sympathies within the army to look for, but also to look within the state systems themselves. After a long day of discussion and planning, the agreement was made; the state would use its resources to formulate a list of possible Trotskyists, who would then be put on trial for treason against the state."
