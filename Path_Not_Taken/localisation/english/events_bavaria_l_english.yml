bavaria.1.d:0 "As a crowd gathers outside of the city hall of Munich, the State Soviet comes out to present a speech, promising the people of Bavaria continued stability and prosperity throughout this new year. The speech ends with praises being given to factories that exceeded state quotas and some notes on the local arts. With cheers from the crowd, the People's Soviet return into the city hall - for their work never ends. "

bavaria.2.t:0 "A Meeting with Stalin"
bavaria.2.d:0 "The air was cold as the members of the Bavarian Soviet walked through Moscow; for they had been called here for a private meeting with Stalin himself. The meeting started out with standard conversation, on the rising economic growth of both nations, and the people's prosperity, but Stalin eventually informed them of a great threat to their stability. The threat of Trotskyism was the greatest danger to Socialism, and Stalin insisted that they must work to crush this snake before it can poison their nation. With this new information in hand, the Bavarian Soviet returned home, ready to defend communism from foolish deviancy."

bavaria.3.t:0 "The Trotskyist Threat"
bavaria.3.d:0 "With knowledge of this new threat at hand, the Bavarian Soviet now started to draw up plans on how to root it out. Stalin made clear note of possible sympathies within the army to look for, but also to look within the state systems themselves. After a long day of discussion and planning, the agreement was made; the state would use its resources to formulate a list of possible Trotskyists, who would then be put on trial for treason against the state."
